# Game Randomizer

This is a small app that will randomly select essentially an entire game for you: jump location, jump master, 
legend, weapons and even challenges(WIP) if so desired and can reroll everything individually if needed. Works for 1 - 3 players 


# Instructions
Step 1: Select number of players and input name if desired.
Step 2: Select map.
Step 3: Select any "extra" options.
Step 4: Click Randomize.
Step 5: Good luck and have fun with your random loadout.
(If needed click the "reroll" button to reroll that option)
